Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _7.341 Of Mice and Men: Humanized Mice in Cancer Research_ as it was taught by Dr. Mandeep Kaur in Spring 2015.

This course introduces students to the latest developments in the fields of cancer biology and immunotherapy. Students explore the concepts of mouse models for human cancer, humanized cancer mice, and cancer immunotherapy by reading recent and classic research articles.

_7.341 Of Mice and Men_ is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars) offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current biological research in a highly interactive setting.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

The main objectives of this course are as follows: 1) to introduce students to the primary scientific literature and the process of reading research publications, and 2) to expose students to the emerging field of humanized mouse models in the development and testing of novel cancer therapies. Course objectives are met through class discussions and take-home/in-class assignments. By the end of the semester students should be able to:

*   Read, comprehend, and critically evaluate the primary research literature
*   Understand how to search for primary research articles relevant to the fields of humanized mice and cancer immunotherapy (PubMed, Google Scholar, MIT Library eJournals, etc.)
*   Orally present papers from the primary scientific literature and engage in discussions
*   Comprehend techniques used to develop various humanized mouse models
*   Understand the relationship between cancer and the immune system, and the potential of cancer immunotherapy
*   Understand how humanized mouse models or Mouse Avatars can be used to improve cancer chemotherapy regimens and develop new immunotherapies

Instructor Insights

{{< quote "I would advise instructors to introduce undergraduate students to primary research literature as early as possible in their educational programs." "— Mandeep Kaur" >}}

_Below, Dr. Mandeep Kaur describes various aspects of how she taught_ _7.341_ _Of Mice and Men: Humanized Mice in Cancer Research_.

### Facilitating Productive Classroom Discussions

The most productive discussions occurred when students read the assigned material prior to class. To help facilitate a productive conversation, I also typically offered a brief introduction to the field and some background material at the beginning of class. We then delved into the papers, with each student presenting one figure.

### Potential for Peer-Assessment

As noted in the [syllabus]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/syllabus), the mid-term assignment prompted students to write an abstract and title for a paper based on figures in a published manuscript (each of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars asks students to complete this assignment). I thought each of the students in this iteration of the course completed the assignment well. In the future, I would like students to evaluate each other’s assignments (blinded) and compare them with the actual abstracts from the papers.

### Primary Research Literature as a Teaching Tool

I would advise instructors to introduce undergraduate students to primary research literature as early as possible in their educational programs. This allows students to learn how to dissect papers and understand the science that is being taught to them from the perspective of the researchers who are performing these groundbreaking discoveries. Teaching students the scientific method and how we have come to understand various aspects about the different scientific disciplines from papers is more useful than lecturing about facts from a textbook.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 6 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class
--------

*   Met 1 time per week for 2 hours per session; 13 sessions total; mandatory attendance.
*   During each session, students discussed two papers from the primary research literature. Students were selected at random to present figures from the papers. In discussing the papers, emphasis was placed on evaluating the hypothesis, experimental design and interpretation of results.
*   At the end of each session, the instructor briefly introduced the papers for the following week.

Out of Class
------------

*   Students were expected to read the assigned papers, to formulate one question per paper, and to send the questions by email to the instructor no later than the night before the class. These questions addressed different aspects of the papers and were discussed during class sessions.
*   In addition, students completed a [mid-term written assignment]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments) and prepared for their [final oral assignment]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments).
